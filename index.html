                    <p>Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark is depicted as an industrialist,
                        genius inventor, and playboy who is Chief Executive Officer of Stark
                        Industries.
                        Initially the chief weapons manufacturer for the United States
                        military,
                        he has a change of heart and redirects his technical knowledge
                        into the creation of mechanized suits of armor which he uses to
                        defend against those that would threaten peace around the world.
                        He becomes a founding member and leader of the Avengers until his
                        death.
                        Tony Stark first premiered as a comic book character, in Tales of Suspense #39 (cover dated
                        March 1963), a collaboration among editor and story-plotter Stan Lee, scripter Larry Lieber,
                        story-artist Don Heck, and cover-artist and character-designer Jack Kirby.Lee wanted to create
                        the "quintessential capitalist", a character that would go against the spirit of the times and
                        Marvel's readership.Lee based this playboy's looks and personality on Howard Hughes, as "one of
                        the most colorful men of our time.

                        Maybe this time. I'm hoping if you play this back... it's in celebration.
                        I hope families are reunited. I hope we get it back, in somewhat like a
                        normal version of the planet has been restored, if there ever was such a thing.
                        <br><br>
                        God, what a world. Universe now. If you told me 10 years ago that we weren't
                        alone, let alone you know to this extent... I mean, I wouldn't have been
                        surprised. But come on, you know. That epic forces of darkness and light
                        that have come into play. And for better or worse, that's the reality
                        Morgan's going to find a way to grow up in. So I found a private area to
                        record a little greeting in case of an untimely death on my part. Not that
                        death at any time is ever timely.

                        me scratching my head about the survivability of all this. But then again
                        that's the hero gig. Part of the journey is the end. What am I tripping for?
                        Everything is going to work out exactly the way it's supposed to.<br><br>
                        I love you 3000."
